    <h2>Joining the Lab</h2>
    <p><strong>Interested in getting involved? We'd love to hear from you.</strong></p>
  <br><br>

    <p>The C.R.O.A.K. Lab is always open to curious, motivated students ‚Äî whether you're 
      exploring research for the first time or already deep into psychology, communication, 
      or data science.
      You don‚Äôt need a perfect GPA, years of experience, or a formal application to join us.</p>
  <br><br>

    <p><strong>Just reach out.</strong><br>
      You can email Dr. LaCour, stop by after class (if you're a ULL student), or set up a
    quick meeting to learn more. We have an open-door policy ‚Äî literally and figuratively.
    You're welcome to poke around, ask questions, and see what we‚Äôre up to before committing
     to anything.</p>
  <br><br>

    <h3>Our Culture</h3>
    <p>Some labs are more exclusive or highly structured. That can be great for focused 
    mentorship or step-by-step training. In our lab, we <strong>err on the side of inclusivity</strong>
     ‚Äî which means we often have a lot of projects going at once,
      and not every newcomer gets a neat to-do list on day one. Instead, we encourage members to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay in regular contact with lab leadership</li>
      <li>Ask about ongoing projects and how you can contribute</li>
      <li>Join and engage in our Discord server (this is <em>the</em> hub for updates, help requests, 
      and discussion)</li>
    </ul>
      <br>

    <p><strong>The more you show up and ask questions, the more you‚Äôll get out of the lab experience.</strong></p>

    
  <br><br>

    <h3>Membership structure: Tadpoles & Full-Fledged Frogs üê∏</h3>
    <p>We know that students have different levels of availability ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay!
      Some people pop in occasionally, contribute a little, and drift out.
      Others stick around, lead projects, and present at conferences. We welcome both!
    </p>

    <p>To keep things organized, we have two informal tiers of lab membership:</p>
    <ul>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Tadpoles</strong> ‚Äì Everyone starts here. You're getting your feet wet, checking things out, and helping out as you‚Äôre able.</li>
      <li><strong>FFF ("triple F", Full-Fledged Frogs)</strong> ‚Äì Members who‚Äôve made 
      sustained contributions. This often means presenting a project at a conference, but 
      it could also mean running a study, helping with data analysis, or contributing to a manuscript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FFF members get their photo and bio featured on the website and tend to be the core team behind our research efforts.</p>

  <br><br>

    <h3>Lab Meetings</h3>
    <p>We hold lab meetings <strong>every other week</strong> during the fall and spring semesters 
    via Zoom. These meetings typically include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project updates</li>
      <li>Discussion of lab business</li>
      <li>Practice presentations or idea pitches</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don‚Äôt have to attend every meeting to be involved, but regular participation is 
      a great path toward becoming a Full-Fledged Frog.
    </p>
    
      <br><br>

    <h3>For ULL Students</h3>
    <p>If you‚Äôre looking for more structure or want to earn course credit, you can enroll 
    in PSYC 397, 497, or 498. Email Dr. LaCour to talk about which course is the best fit.</p>
