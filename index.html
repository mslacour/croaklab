      <h2>Welcome to the CROAK Lab</h2>
      <p>
        We study communication, rationality, opinions, attitudes, and knowledge
        — exploring how people think and talk about the world.
        <br>
        The C.R.O.A.K. Lab is a group of behavioral scientists and students dedicated to examining how people make decisions and form beliefs. We are particularly interested in how these processes relate to public health, e.g., vaccine hesitancy, risk communication, disease mitigation behaviors. Another part of our mission is to mentor early career researchers and professionals, training them in the latest data analytic techniques and open science practices. We aspire for all our lab members to be high achieving, and to leave the C.R.O.A.K. Lab with valuable skills, even if they haven't chosen research as their primary career path.
		<br>
		To inquire about joining the lab, check out our 'Ongoing Projects' and reach out to either Dr. Mark LaCour or Dr. Zebulon Bell about which projects you are interested in working on and/or which skills you hope to acquire while working with us.
