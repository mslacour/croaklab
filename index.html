    <h2>Welcome to the C.R.O.A.K. Lab</h2>
    
    <p>We study how people think, communicate, and make decisions about the world around 
    them. Our research explores communication, rationality, opinions, attitudes, and 
    knowledge (hence the "CROAK") — especially in high-stakes, real-world contexts like 
    public health.</p>
    
    <br>
    
  <p>We explore a vast array of topics -- vaccine hesitancy, celebrity worship -- 
  	investigating how beliefs are formed 
    and how they influence behavior. Our team of behavioral scientists and student researchers 
    combines theory, data, and open science practices to better understand everyday 
    judgment, decision-making, and belief processes.</p>
 
 <br>
 
  <p>The C.R.O.A.K. Lab is also a space for growth. We’re committed to mentoring early-career 
  researchers — helping them build data skills, apply cutting-edge methods, and contribute 
  meaningfully to science, whether they pursue academia, industry, or other paths.</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>Whether you're a psychology major, a curious non-major, or someone outside the university 
  altogether — we're glad you're here. Come explore the work we do, the people behind it, 
  and the questions that keep us thinking.</p>
